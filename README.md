# Berlin Clock

The Mengenlehreuhr (German for "Set Theory Clock") or Berlin-Uhr ("Berlin Clock") is the first public clock in the world that tells the time using illuminated, colored fields, for which it entered the Guinness Book of Records upon its installation on 17 June 1975. Commissioned by the Senate of Berlin and designed by Dieter Binninger, the original full-sized Mengenlehreuhr was originally located at the Kurfürstendamm on the corner with Uhlandstraße. After the Senate decommissioned it in 1995, the clock was relocated to a site in Budapester Straße in front of Europa-Center, where it stands today.

This characteristic clock tells the time using a series of illuminated colored blocks and it's read from top to bottom.

* The top big lamp - (yellow) - (blinks to show seconds and it's illuminated only on even seconds).

* The first line - 4 lamps (red) - (each lamp represents five hours).

* The second line - 4 lamps (red) - (each lamp represents one hour).

* The third line - 11 lamps (yellow, every 3rd is red) - (each lamp represents five minutes).

* The fourth line - 4 lamps (yellow) - (each lamp represents one minute).


## How to Run

This project demonstrates a Berlin Clock implementation using SwiftUI in Swift.

### Prerequisites

- Xcode 13.0 or later
- Swift 5.5 or later

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/2024-DEV2-006/MyTest.git

2. Open the Xcode project:

    open BerlinClock.xcodeproj


3. Build and run the project in Xcode.

    - Choose a simulator or a physical device as the target.
    - Click the "Run" button (or use Cmd + R).

4. The Berlin Clock app should now be running on your selected device or simulator.

### Usage
